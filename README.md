Prerequisites for Running the Application: Java SDK 17, Node.js, MySQL, VS Code, Spring Tool Suite, web browser.

    Clone the GitHub repository onto your local machine.
    Open the backend folder using Spring Tool Suite (STS).
    Under src/main/resources, locate a file named application.properties. Open it and add your username and password for the local instance of MySQL. Change the database name from "test" to your desired database.
    Run the application as a Spring Boot application. STS will automatically download all the dependencies and run the application.
    Navigate to the frontend folder and go to the "grocery" folder.
    Open it using Visual Studio Code.
    To download all the dependencies, execute the command "npm install".
    This command will install all the dependencies required to run the React app.
    Once the download finishes, type in the command "npm start".
    It may take some time, and the app will open up in a web browser.
    Now, you can test the web app.
